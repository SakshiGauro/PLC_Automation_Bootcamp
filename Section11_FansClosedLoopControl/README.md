# Chapter 11: Industrial Fans Closed Loop Control

This chapter covers **Industrial Fans Closed-Loop (Alternating) Control** using **timers** in the **LogixPro simulator**, following along with the video tutorial.


### [ðŸŽ¥ Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpN1qZh7Eg)

In this exercise, youâ€™ll design a control system for **three industrial fans** that operate in an **alternating sequence** using timers.  
The process is controlled by a single **Start** and **Stop** push button.  
The logic ensures that each fan operates **one at a time**, alternating in a repeating timed cycle â€” preventing simultaneous operation and ensuring balanced load distribution.

### Concept Overview

This setup uses **three TON (Timer ON Delay)** timers to manage the switching sequence between the fans.  
When the system starts:

> **Fan 1** starts immediately 
> after **5 seconds**, **Fan 2** starts and **Fan 1 stops**  
> after **5 seconds**, **Fan 3** starts and **Fan 2 stops**  
> after another **5 seconds**, **Fan 1** starts again and **Fan 3 stops** â€” creating a **closed-loop rotation**.

The **Stop** button instantly halts whichever fan is active and resets all timers.

### Visual Representation

This video  illustrates the **closed-loop alternating sequence** of operation:
> **Fan 1 â†’ (5s delay) â†’ Fan 2 â†’ (5s delay) â†’ Fan 3 â†’ (5s delay) â†’ Fan 1** *(loop continues)*

## Parameters 

| I/O Simulator | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| ![startstop](image.png) | **Start/Stop Switches** â€” One *Normally Open (NO)* Start button and one *Normally Closed (NC)* Stop button for controlling all fans. |
| ![t1](image-2.png) | **Timer T1** â€” Controls delay between Fan 1 and Fan 2. |
| ![t2](image-3.png)| **Timer T2** â€” Controls delay between Fan 2 and Fan 3. |
| ![t2!](image-4.png) | **Timer T3** â€” Controls delay between Fan 3 and Fan 1. |
| ![lampsOFF](image-5.png) ![lampON](image-6.png)| **Indicator Lamps** â€” Represent the ON state of Fan 1, Fan 2, and Fan 3 respectively. |

## Fan Operation Sequence with Timers

This logic demonstrates how the three fans operate alternately using **TON** timers, ensuring that only one fan is energized at any given time.

| Ladder Code | I/O Simulator | Description |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| ![fan1](image-7.png) | ![iofan1](image-12.png)| When the **Start (NO)** button is pressed, **Fan 1** energizes immediately, and **Timer T1** begins counting. The **Stop (NC)** button de-energizes **Fan 1** and resets **T1**. |
| ![fan2](image-8.png) ![stopf1](image-9.png)| ![iofan2](image-13.png) | Once **Timer T1** completes its preset delay (5 seconds), its **Done (DN)** bit turns ON, energizing **Fan 2** and starting **Timer T2**. Meanwhile, **Fan 1** de-energizes due to the inverse rung logic. The **Stop (NC)** button de-energizes **Fan 2** and resets **T2**. |
| ![fan3](image-10.png) | ![iofan3](image-14.png) | When **Timer T2** completes its delay (5 seconds), its **Done (DN)** bit energizes **Fan 3**, and **Fan 2** de-energizes simultaneously. Pressing the **Stop** button halts the process and resets the timers. |
| ![fanloop](image-11.png)![stopf1](image-9.png)| ![iofanloop](image-16.png)| After **Timer T3** completes its delay (5 seconds), its **Done (DN)** bit re-energizes **Fan 1**, and **Fan 3** turns OFF, hence, completing the cycle. The process repeats continuously until the **Stop** button is pressed. |

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**  
> Closed-loop or alternating fan control is widely used in **industrial ventilation**, **HVAC systems**, and **motor load sharing** applications.  
> It ensures **even equipment wear**, **balanced power consumption**, and **redundant operation** for continuous processes.

## Assignment 3

Use a start switch and a stop switch connected as 2 digital inputs to the PLC
use 2 indication lamps connected as 2 digital outputs of the PLC which simulates the working operation of the 2 motors

1) if we pressed on the start switch the first motor will run for 5 second then the second motor will run for 5 second while running the first motor
2) after the 5 seconds of the running operation of the second motor , the 2 motors will stop running
3) if you pressed on the stop switch at any time all of the system will be turned off
