# Chapter 5: Industrial Fans Interlocking
This chapter covers **Industrial Fans Interlocking PLC ladder logic** using the **LogixPro simulator**, following along with the video tutorial.

In this exercise, youâ€™ll design a control system for **two industrial fans** that **cannot operate simultaneously**.  
Each fan has its own **Start** and **Stop** push buttons. The program ensures that one fan must be **turned OFF before** the other can be started â€” preventing hardware damage or overload.

## Parameters 
| I/O Simulator | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
|![fan1](image.png)| Start and stop switches for **Pull fan**|
|![fan2](image-1.png)| Start and stop switches for **Push fan**|
|![fans output](image-2.png)| Indicator lamps for **Pull fan** and **Push fan** respectively|

## Two Fans working independently
This logic demonstrates basic operation where each fan can be started and stopped using its own buttons â€” **without interlocking**.

| Ladder Code | I/O Simulator | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
|![alt text](image-3.png)|![alt text](image-6.png)| When the **Start 1 (NO)** button is pressed, the **Pull Fan** coil energizes. Pressing the **Stop 1 (NC)** button breaks the circuit and turns the fan OFF. |
|![alt text](image-5.png)| ![alt text](image-7.png)| When the **Start 2 (NO)** button is pressed, the **Push Fan** coil energizes. Pressing the **Stop 2 (NC)** button de-energizes the fan. |
|![both](image-8.png)|![bothh](image-9.png)|Both fans can run **at the same time** in this setup. This illustrates the limitation that will be addressed with the **interlocking feature**. |

## Interlocking Feature 
In this improved logic, **only one fan can run at a time**.  
If one fan is running, the other fanâ€™s Start button will not energize its output coil until the first fan is stopped.

| Ladder Code | I/O Simulator | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
|![interlocking](image-10.png)|![io](image-11.png)|When the **Pull Fan** is energized and the **Start 2** button is pressed, the **Push Fan** does **not** energize because the Pull Fanâ€™s output is interlocked with its rung. The same logic applies in reverse â€” the Pull Fan cannot start while the Push Fan is running.|

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**  
> Interlocking logic is common in **industrial ventilation**, **motor sequencing**, and **safety systems**.  
> Always verify interlocks in simulation before deploying to real hardware.
