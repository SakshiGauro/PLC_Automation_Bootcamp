# Chapter 10: Industrial Fans One way Sequence with timers

This chapter covers **Industrial Fans One-Way Sequence PLC ladder logic** using **timers** in the **LogixPro simulator**, following along with the video tutorial.

### [ðŸŽ¥ Watch here](https://youtu.be/9iUPSFRZVeo)

In this exercise, youâ€™ll design a control system for **three industrial fans** that operate in a **sequential order** with **timed delays**.  
The sequence is controlled by **one Start** and **one Stop** push button.  
The program ensures that each fan starts after a fixed delay, preventing simultaneous operation and allowing controlled sequencing.

---

### Concept Overview

This setup uses **two timers** to delay the activation of subsequent fans.  
When the system starts:

> Fan 1 starts immediately â†’ Fan 2 starts **5 seconds later** â†’ Fan 3 starts **5 seconds after Fan 2**

The **Stop** button immediately halts all fans and resets both timers.

### Visual Representation

This diagram illustrates the **sequential operation**:
> **Fan 1 â†’ (5s delay) â†’ Fan 2 â†’ (5s delay) â†’ Fan 3**

## Parameters 

| I/O Simulator | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| ![startstop](image-4.png) | **Start/Stop Switches** â€” One *Normally Open (NO)* Start button and one *Normally Closed (NC)* Stop button for controlling all fans. |
| ![t1](image-5.png) | **Timer T1** â€” Controls delay between Fan 1 and Fan 2. |
| ![t2](image-6.png) | **Timer T2** â€” Controls delay between Fan 2 and Fan 3. |
| ![lampsOFF](image-7.png) ![lampON](image-8.png)| **Indicator Lamps** â€” Represent the ON state of Fan 1, Fan 2, and Fan 3 respectively. |


## Fan Operation Sequence with Timers

This logic demonstrates how the fans operate sequentially using **TON (Timer ON Delay)** instructions.

| Ladder Code | I/O Simulator | Description |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| ![fan1](image.png) | ![iofan1](image-3.png) | When the **Start (NO)** button is pressed, **Fan 1** energizes immediately. Simultaneously, **Timer T1** starts counting. Pressing the **Stop (NC)** button de-energizes Fan 1 and resets Timer T1. |
| ![fan2](image-1.png) | ![iofan2](image-9.png) | Once **Timer T1** completes its preset delay (5 seconds), its **Done (DN)** bit turns ON, energizing **Fan 2** and starting **Timer T2**. The Stop button de-energizes both Fan 1 and Fan 2, resetting the timers. |
| ![fan3](image-2.png) | ![iofan3](image-10.png) | After **Timer T2** completes its delay (5 seconds), its **Done (DN)** bit energizes **Fan 3**. Pressing the Stop button de-energizes all fans and resets both timers, returning the system to idle. |

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**  
>  One-way sequencing logic is often used in **industrial ventilation**, **cooling towers**, or **multi-stage motor control systems**.  
> It ensures balanced power usage and prevents reverse airflow or system overloads.
