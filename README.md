## ‚≠ê Overview

This repository contains my complete learning journey through the Udemy course  
**[The Complete PLC & Classic Control (Software / Hardware) Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/105G4W3@HYvCtsWjXz68GV_yyRMsShtw6TrDvDtnzklwQ9iZvj4BC9tVeJ-O3JVqU6mWnmYO/)**.  
It includes lecture notes, simulation files, wiring diagrams, and reference material ‚Äî all organized to make review and reuse easy.

The goal of this repo is to document and demonstrate my applied understanding of industrial automation, from **basic relay control** to **PLC-based factory systems**.
