## Timers
This chapter explains the concept and operation of **Timers** in PLC programming using the **LogixPro simulator**.

### [üé• Watch here](insert link)

Timers are control elements that **delay actions** for a set period after receiving an input signal.  
Unlike relays ‚Äî which respond **instantaneously**, timers **wait** for a specified time interval before activating or deactivating outputs.

Timers are commonly used in automation to control **sequence delays**, **machine startup/shutdown timing**, **pulsing**, and **safety interlocks**.

## Types of Timers

### 1. **ON-Delay Timer (TON)**

The **ON-Delay Timer** delays the output signal for a preset duration **after the input turns ON**.  
If the input remains ON longer than the set time, the timer output activates.

#### Behavior:
- When the **input signal = 0**, the **output = 0**.  
- When the **input signal = 1** for **less than** the set delay time, the **output remains 0**.  
- When the **input signal = 1** for **longer than** the delay time, the **output becomes 1** ‚Äî meaning the **Normally Open (NO)** contact closes, and the **Normally Closed (NC)** contact opens.  
- When the **input returns to 0**, the **output resets to 0**.

> üß† **Note:**  
> The ON-Delay Timer activates **after** the input remains ON for the set delay time.

### 2. **OFF-Delay Timer (TOF)**

The **OFF-Delay Timer** delays turning the output **OFF** for a preset duration **after the input turns OFF**.  
In other words, the output remains ON for the set delay time once the input signal goes to 0.

#### Behavior:
- When the **input = 0**, the **output = 0**.  
- When the **input = 1**, the **output = 1** immediately (no delay).  
- When the **input = 0**, the **output remains 1** for the delay period, then turns OFF after the set time expires.

### 3. **Retentive ON-Delay Timer (RTO)**

The **Retentive Timer** (memory timer) accumulates total ON time across multiple input cycles.  
It ‚Äúremembers‚Äù elapsed time even if the input signal turns OFF ‚Äî until it is manually reset.

#### Behavior:
- The timer **adds up all previous ON durations**.  
- If the **accumulated ON time < preset time**, the **output = 0**.  
- When the **accumulated ON time ‚â• preset time**, the **output = 1** ‚Äî the **NO** contact closes and the **NC** contact opens.  
- Once the **output = 1**, it remains ON until the timer is **reset**.  
- Resetting the timer clears the accumulated time.

#### Example:
If the preset time is **30 minutes**:
- The timer is ON for 5 min ‚Üí OFF ‚Üí ON for 3 min ‚Üí OFF ‚Üí ON for 10 min  
  Total accumulated time = **18 min**, so output remains **OFF**.  
- If it later runs ON for another 15 min (total 33 min), output turns **ON** and stays ON until reset.

> **Note:**  
> Retentive timers are useful in applications where **elapsed time must be preserved** through power loss or process interruptions (e.g., batch processing or warm-up timers).

## Summary

| Timer Type | Abbreviation | Description | Key Behavior |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **ON-Delay Timer** | TON | Delays output activation after input turns ON. | Output turns ON *after* preset time elapses. |
| **OFF-Delay Timer** | TOF | Delays output deactivation after input turns OFF. | Output remains ON *for* preset time after input turns OFF. |
| **Retentive ON-Delay Timer** | RTO | Accumulates ON time across cycles until reset. | Output turns ON once total ON time ‚â• preset time. |

> üí° **Tip:**  
> Timers are foundational for **sequential logic control** ‚Äî such as conveyor delays, machine startup timing, and coordinated motion.  
> Always ensure timers are properly reset when designing repeating or looping automation logic.

##  PLC Delay Timer in LogixPro

### TON (Timer ON-Delay)

In this section, we‚Äôll use the **TON (Timer ON-Delay)** instruction in **LogixPro** to introduce a delay before an output turns ON.

### Timer Components in LogixPro

Here‚Äôs what the **TON** timer block looks like in the LogixPro simulator:

![ton](image-2.png)

### Parameters

#### **Inputs**
- **Timer:** The address assigned to the timer. You can use any address between **T4:0 ‚Äì T4:99**.  
  *Example:* `T4:1`
- **Time Base:** The factor used to calculate total delay time.  
  *Example:* `0.1` (each time unit equals 0.1 seconds)
- **Preset Value:** The set time duration before the output activates.  
  *Example:* `100` ‚Üí Delay = `100 √ó 0.1 = 10 seconds`
- **Accumulated Value (Accum):** Displays the current elapsed time while the timer is counting.

#### **Outputs**
- **EN (Enable Bit):** Turns ON whenever the timer input is energized (logic HIGH).  
- **DN (Done Bit):** Turns ON after the accumulated time equals the preset time ‚ûî signaling that the timer has completed its delay.

### Mini Example ‚Äì Lamp Delay Project

**Goal:** Energize a lamp **10 seconds after** pressing a toggle switch.

| Ladder Code | I/O Simulator | Description |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| ![ladder](image-ladder.png) | ![io](image-io.png) | When the **Toggle Switch** is pressed, the **TON timer (T4:1)** starts counting. Once the **Accumulated Value (Accum)** reaches the **Preset Value** of 10 seconds, the **Done (DN)** bit turns ON and energizes the **Lamp**. If the toggle switch is turned OFF before the timer completes, the timer resets and the lamp remains OFF. Turning OFF the toggle switch also turns OFF the lamp and resets the timer.|

> üß† **Key Concept:**  
> The **TON** instruction is commonly used for delayed starts ‚Äî for example, motor sequencing, staged activation, or warning lights that need to turn ON after a fixed delay.
